// The leg assembly and fan-out behind `gc ready`.
//
// # Why this exists
//
// On a split city the graph-class DAG — `gcg-` molecule roots, step beads,
// control beads — lives in the relocated graph store, and `bd ready` in the work
// directory cannot reach it. Measured on a live city at one moment: `gc bd ready`
// answered with 5 beads and ZERO `gcg-`, while GET /v0/beads/ready answered with
// 22 beads, 14 of them `gcg-`. The CLI was blind in bulk behind an answer that
// looked authoritative.
//
// # The contract this implements is the API's, not a new one
//
// internal/api's humaHandleBeadReady carries an executable FEDERATION CONTRACT
// (#5148) that this file is specified against, so the conformance assertion is
// CLI == API rather than an invented oracle:
//
//   - Legs, in order: the city store, then the rigs by name ascending, then the
//     relocated graph store LAST.
//   - Within a leg: whatever order that leg's own Ready reader emits. That is
//     canonical (priority, created_at, id) for a caching-wrapped work store, but
//     NOT for the graph leg — the canonical relocated binding is a
//     beads.SQLiteStore whose ready SQL orders by (created_at, id) with no
//     priority term. Per-leg order is deterministic, not canonical.
//   - Dedupe: the FIRST leg to return an id wins. The graph leg runs last, so a
//     bead co-resident in the work store and the binding — the documented steady
//     state of a migrated city, where `gc storage migrate` preserves ids and
//     never deletes back — resolves to the work store's row on both surfaces.
//
// # Where this deliberately diverges: no partial tier
//
// What the API actually does, leg by leg, because the divergence is only
// meaningful stated against the real thing:
//
//   - A RIG leg that fails — whether it failed to OPEN, in which case
//     controllerState.buildStores puts an unavailableStore in the map and every
//     read of it returns that open error, or failed to READ — degrades to a
//     Partial 200 whose partial_errors name the rig.
//   - The GRAPH leg does not degrade: humaHandleBeadReady returns 503
//     (graphPlaneUnavailable), carrying any rig errors recorded before it.
//   - A rig declared in city.toml with no .gc/site.toml binding has an empty
//     rig.Path and is SKIPPED, with no store and no message.
//
// A CLI work query has no `partial_errors` field: its whole output is the array,
// and a short array is indistinguishable from "no work". So where the API can be
// honestly partial, this command cannot, and every leg it federates fails LOUD —
// at BOTH ends. federateBeadLegs is the read end. readyRigLegStores is the open
// end, and it is the end that was the hole: leg assembly runs before any read, so
// a rig store that could not be opened used to be dropped by the builder, warned
// about on a stream no work query parses, and answered with exit 0 and a
// valid-looking short array. That is the exact fail-open this command exists to
// close, re-created one layer up.
//
// The UNBOUND rig is left skipped, matching the API. It is not a leg the city
// failed to reach — it is a rig with no store at all, so no claimable row is
// hiding behind it, and the acceptance criterion for this whole slice is CLI ==
// API. Promoting it to an error is a defensible product decision, but it is a
// behavior change that has to land on BOTH surfaces at once.
//
// # Every leg answers the SAME question
//
// The legs are not wrapped alike. A work store sits behind cmd/gc's bead-policy
// layer, which rewrites a TierIssues read to TierBoth before it reaches the
// backend; a relocated class store has no such layer, because openStorageRoutes
// keys the class map straight to the engine value the provider returned. So a
// query that leaves TierMode at its zero value asks the work legs one question
// and the class leg a narrower one, and the merge presents the two as one
// answer. The class store's ephemeral tier — the wisps an orchestration step
// runs as — drops out with no error and no short-array signal (ga-8lyxc).
//
// Every read below therefore states beads.FederatedReadTier explicitly on every
// leg. That is the tier the policy-wrapped legs have always answered at, so it
// changes nothing for a city that relocates no class.
//
// # Single-store cities take none of this
//
// The leg set is Plan(RoutedWork) over the city's topology, and a city that
// relocates nothing has no binding in that topology — so it gets no graph leg at
// all and its answer is exactly the one leg it always had. The gate is STORE
// IDENTITY, the same rule the API's relocatedGraphStore and cmd/gc's
// resolveClassStore use: a binding that resolved back to the work store is
// deduped by the plan rather than federated twice.
